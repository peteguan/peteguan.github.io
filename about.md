## About ME

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/villa_broadcasting.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Pete Cheng Guan.

我叫 关程华宸。  

I was born in Shenyang, China.  

I got my MSc in the University of Birmingham in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Mark D. Ryan](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/) and [Dr. Ian Batten](https://www.batten.eu.org/~igb/) in cyber security field. During the college time, I focused on penetration testing, crypto suite in network protocols and password management.

I joined [ctrip.com](http://ctrip.com/) at the very beginning of 2018, working as an Site Reliability Engineer, and started to learn DevOps techniques about CDN, GSLB and new programming langs like python and golang here. In saying that, everything is new for me but deserving to enjoy.
