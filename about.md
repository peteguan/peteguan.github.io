## About ME

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/villa_broadcasting.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Pete Cheng Guan.

我叫 关程华宸。  

I was born in Shenyang, China.  

I got my MSc in the University of Birmingham in 2017, supervised by [Prof. Mark D. Ryan](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/) and [Dr. Ian Batten](https://www.batten.eu.org/~igb/) in cyber security field. During the college time, I focused on penetration testing, crypto suite in network protocols and password management.

I joined [ctrip.com](http://ctrip.com/) at the very beginning of 2018, working as an Site Reliability Engineer. I started to learn DevOps techniques such as CDN, GSLB and new programming langs like python and golang here. In saying that, everything is new for me but deserving to enjoy.



### Spare Time



I started to play guitar when I was a kid and music has been an important part in my life. Collecting equipments is what I am interested.
