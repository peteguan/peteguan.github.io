In China, PC users could install applications like <i>tencent PC manager</i> to test downloading and uploading speed. However, Mac users and Linux server administrators might want to know their bandwidth in specific scenes. If you have a screen and a web browser, just click <i>GO</i> on [speedtest.org](http://www.speedtest.net/) home page could be the easiest way. If you don't, no worries, a command line tool [<i><b>speedtest-cli</b></i>](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli.wiki.git) will help you.
